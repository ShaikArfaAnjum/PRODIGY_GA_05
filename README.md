Task-05: Neural Style Transfer using Generative AI (Prodigy Infotech Internship)
## Neural Style Transfer using Generative AI  
This project is part of the **Prodigy Infotech Generative AI Internship (Task-05)**.


### 📌 Task Description  
This project is part of the **Prodigy Infotech – Generative AI Internship (Task-05)**.  
The objective of this task is to implement **Neural Style Transfer (NST)**, a Generative AI technique that applies the artistic style of one image to the content of another image.

---

### 🎨 What is Neural Style Transfer?  
Neural Style Transfer is a Generative AI approach that uses deep neural networks to combine:
- **Content Image** → structure and objects of an image  
- **Style Image** → artistic patterns, colors, and textures  

The output image preserves the content while adopting the artistic style.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Pre-trained VGG19 model  
- Pillow (PIL)  
- Google Colab  

---

### 📂 Project Workflow  
1. Upload a **content image** (e.g., nature photo)
2. Upload a **style image** (e.g., painting or artistic image)
3. Extract content and style features using VGG19
4. Optimize a target image using:
   - Content loss  
   - Style loss  
5. Generate a stylized output image

---

### 📸 Input Images  
- **Content Image:** Any real-world photo (nature, person, object)  
- **Style Image:** Painting or artistic-style image  

---

### 🖼️ Output  
- A new image that visually combines:
  - Content from the content image  
  - Artistic style from the style image  

---

### ✅ Internship Domain  
**Generative AI (GA)**  
This project focuses on image generation and transformation, aligning with Generative AI concepts.
